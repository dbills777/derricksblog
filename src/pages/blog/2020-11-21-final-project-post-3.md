This week I focused on building the rating system. I was able to use CSS to style and update the number of highlighted stars for a recipe rating. And send the data attribute back to the DB and update the rating property.

11. **As a user I would like to Rate recipes.**
12. **As a user I would like to Change Rating recipes.**

The star system works well on a single recipe view, but when I have all the recipes displayed it becomes more difficult to select the lists and render them correctly.

I will keep working on this aspect for next week and start implementing some filtering into the application. ie categories, rating, updated time, create time etc. 

I will also start on the styling of the app for the finished product.
