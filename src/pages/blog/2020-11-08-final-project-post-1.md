My application is the recipe application outline for the final project, it will function as an application for viewing and cataloging of various recipes and allow users to create and manage elements of each individual recipe. 

* What have you done this week?

  This week I was focused on the broader view of how my application would be developed. It will follow a similar development patter to the Todo Application. It will have a seperate front end build that is served up as a static site and the server application will connect to a mongo database, with multiple collections. 

  My application is at a stage of being ready for development to occur. The skeleton and structure of the application is all setup, I like to develop this way to have a clear base of where I am that also allows for changes to be made if I decide to implement something different such as a template engine or using a different database model. 
* What do you plan on doing next week?

  For the next week I am going to spend some time in the specifics of how the application will flow. I want to map out where I want the app to progress from the starting page to adding a new item to showing a list of recipes, to editing a recipe. 
* What roadblocks did you encounter and what did you do to overcome them?

  The roadblocks I encountered were around how to structure an initial plan. one of note, was thinking if I wanted to have multiple html pages or display all the items on one single page. I have initially chose to display multiple pages to separate and input of a recipe from the full list of recipes. Mainly to clean up what the user sees and not have too many things going on for one page of the application.
