1. SQL is a relational database, and this type of database is the most popular and most widely used database. SQL is the language used in most relational databases. They are typically selected for their quick learning curves and the ability to modify entries quickly and easily. A disadvantage of this type of database is that all the items in the database must be known prior to rolling out the database. This rigidity allows for them to be very powerful when it comes to large scale data systems. The relational structure allows for great encapsulation of data to deter repetition and deeply nested items. 
2. NoSQL These databases do not use SQL as the language of access. Graph databases, Network Databases and Document databases like MongoDB are members of this category. NoSQL databases are extremely changagle and do not need to be completely mapped out in the beginning. They can be easily changed and modified to fit the needs of your application as it progresses through time. This sets them apart from SQL databases and has helped them gain traction among many developers. There are several different types inside of the larger group. Graph, Column and Object are just a few. they are best utilized for projects that need to change data schemas on the fly or are likely to need changes in the future. 
3. Graph Databases use a graph structure for semantic queries, some of these graph databases have a huge advantage in the fact that developers are able to query only the data they are after rather than an entire tree of data.  They are great when needing to analyze data, they typically rely on connections and relationships between nodes and do a great job when needing to gain insight on massive datasets. They were created to fill in some of the limitations of relational databases.
