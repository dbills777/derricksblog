      What do you plan on doing next week?

      Continue working on the database schemas and some of the logical functionality of the application. 

      My plan is to utilize ejs partial files to hold each piece of logic and display as a component of sorts and be able to utilize them in any page that I send back as a request. This will allow for easy maintenance, and reusability.

      Work on the UI and layout of the application to flow better. As far as roadblocks, I didn't really have any, there were a few things that I had to spend time to solve but nothing I would consider an obstruction to my progress.
