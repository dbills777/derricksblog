TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript for both Client and Server side development. As more and more features have been added to JavaScript so has the need for it to become more strictly typed. Meaning that accounting for our data types in the development stage we can prevent the amount of bugs that arise during the development stage. 



Typescript is compiled down to javascript in the development stage, in order to check for errors while developing is ongoing there is a transpiler that provides the error checking needed to avoid time consuming bugs. This transpiler included in typescript brings the errors to light before the finial compiling of the Typescript code. The method of defining types on a regular basis also helps as a reminder of what is going in, out, and being worked on in a piece of code. TypeScript acts in a way as a good "commenting" assistant when refactoring older code bases. 



TypeScript helps developers write code that is inherently less prone to errors by defining the types of data as data is moved from item to item. This not only ensures the functions operate properly at the time of writing but it also adds additional protection against possible side effects that otherwise would not have been accounted for if it were not strictly typed. Testing can cover a good amount of the possible cases, but the addition of Typescript can all but eliminate the need for ensuring all types have been tested against the outcome of a particular code block.
