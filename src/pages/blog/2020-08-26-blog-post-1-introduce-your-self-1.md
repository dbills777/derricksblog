### About Me

Hi, my name is Derrick Bills and I have been enrolled in the Web Development program at UVU since Fall of 2019, Prior to that I worked as a Pharmacy Technician for nearly 20 years. I had planned to return to school many, many years ago and finally did in 2018. I have a Daughter who is almost 14 years old and a Doberman dog who is is 5. 

Some things we like to do are vacations! We try to go on a few a year (although haven't made it out yet during Covid). One of our favorite spots is to visit family who live in Northern California, Having access to an amazing river and some excellent wineries is amazing. 

My favorite part of Web Development is that it is constantly evolving and expanding. This contrast to my previous work is great! Web Development has many avenues that we as developers can expand into if we so wish. We also have the ability to transfer our skills to a more traditional CS career path if we put in the work to fill in the knowledge gaps. I generally operate under the idea that if I can learn one programming language I can learn many.

I originally started my Journey back to school with enrolling in the computer science program at UVU and completed some of the introduction/foundational courses in that degree. at this point I realized that I really enjoyed to the web technologies more and switched my focus. I started learning Javascript mostly on my own through some of the more common channels. YouTube, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp and have continued to expand on those basics. 

What I hope to gain from this class is an increase in knowledge as to things I call Unknown Unknown's. These are aspects of the language and career path that I do not yet know about and need to build skills in to be a successful Web Developer.
