* How do you personally research on the web?

I like to include the names of sites that I like to see in the results. Some of these are freecodecamp, MDN, W3 Schools, StackOverflow and other reputable websites. This helps narrow down the results to sources that often lend the best results.

* What tips and tricks do you have to search the web?

After time you become aware of some of the better and some of the not so good sources of information. Making sure that when you are searching for a topic you also include a good reliable source in the search term can cut down on the amount of time spent searching for information to solve a problem.

* What is "Tutorial Hell"?

When a person gets stuck in the loop of following allowing with instructors on how to build applications or learn new topics. In the beginning the exposure to tutorials can help to teach a learner to the expansive possibilities of development. However after time this can hold one back from actually learning in a way that leads to true understanding of the topic.

* How do you best learn development and JavaScript?

Now that I have a solid understanding of the core concepts, Learning by doing is best for me. Picking a project I want to build, jumping into the code and using the web to find items when I run into a roadblock. Has worked out great for me.

* How would you recommend someone new to web development learn the skill and why?

Initially I do think working through tutorials is a good idea. The main reason I like this idea is because it can give those with little to no knowledge a quick view of what is possible in the world of web development. After they have a decent amount of exposure I would recommend working through the learning documents on MDN. These docs are structured in a great way to assist with retaining some of the key concepts of Javascript.
