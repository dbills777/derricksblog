### JAMStack



Static Websites some of the quickest to deploy and most prevalent types of sites on the web. We have the ability to roll out a new site in a short amount of time and have it ready for content. Often times the content writers are not the ones who have created the site or application. This can lead to a difficulty in being able to quickly update the sites and add new content. The JAMStack seeks to solve this issue. It uses JavaScript API's and Markdown as the primary tools to allow those with little to no web development experience to add content quickly and easily.



Giving the ability to update a page to a wider group of people is awesome. This lessens the need for a developer to update the site and re-deploy it every time a new item is to be added to a page. It really adds a level of ease to site maintenance and updating.



Web Developers can show clients or coworkers how to update a site using a variety of tools, one of the main ways to add content is the "M" in JAMStack, using a markdown file as a "database" of sorts. this means content can be written in plain text and consumed by the webpage using API's and Javascript. There are also other ways that the data can be added, like a CMS



I chose to use Netlify CMS combined with a template they provided on how to create a JAMStack site using gatsby. It was my first time using Netlify CMS or any CMS really to quickly update a page. This summer I came across a project that used Google Sheets as a database and was able to update elements on a page using data entered into a Google Sheet as the source of information. It worked, however not as well or as secure as this process is. seeing how that worked and its downsides pushed me to choose this route as a solution. So far it has shown to be a great way to quickly add a new blog post to the page in a consistent manner and has many applications it can be applied to in the future.
