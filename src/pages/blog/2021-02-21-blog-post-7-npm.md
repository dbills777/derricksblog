NPM is a package/module manager for applications that utilize the NodeJS platform. One of NPM's primary functions is to be a hub for publishing, discovering, and installing of node programs and operations.



NPM offers an environment to manage a project's dependencies and tools. It can do this locally or through cloud management. This creates the ability to share and organize all of a projects NodeJS related resources in a single place. The benefit of being able to remotely organize a project and update all of that projects dependences allows for a cohesive development experience. 



Simply put an NPM module is any directory, file or piece of code that can be loaded using the require() function of Node and contain a package.json file. 

NPM consist of 3 main components: the website, the CLI and the registry. 

The website is mainly for discovery, management and organized of both private and public packages. This creates an environment that is perfect for remote teams and collaboration from anywhere in the world. 

The CLI is the route that developers install and utilize NPM packages & and the registry is a database of all the information created by each NPM package, The registry grants access to both public and private packages from anywhere. The large coverage of these three main components is what makes NPM such a powerful tool for developers involved in NodeJS development.
