**Post 7 - Svelte**

**Watch the following YouTube video:** [Rich Harris - Rethinking reactivity (Links to an external site.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao&feature=emb_title)

* Name 3 ideas that stood out to you from the video. Explain in detail, why are they important.

Right from the beginning of his talked his approach to problem solving was great to see. Rather than setting out to build a new front end library, he asked the question at the heart of the issue; "What is Reactive Programming". I really like this approach, it allows the opportunity to really tackle all the issues and keeps his vision of a complete solution intact. He's not just looking to take react and change it to something better he is trying to fill an original need and letting that be his underlying goal.

This leads him to another fundamental idea in programming not repeating yourself and not using more resources than are necessary to tackle an issue. The Virtual DOM example highlights the overall cost of the way react operates. It does have the ability to solve the problem but there may be a more efficient way of doing it. Looking at a problem the way Rich does is a great example of how to gain a high level view of the problem and to start to systematically tackle those issues through the eyes of cost / benefit methodology.
